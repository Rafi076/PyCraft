To integrate a REST API with Flutter, it's important to understand how APIs work and why tools like Postman are used during the development and testing process.

What is an API?
==> API (Application Programming Interface) allows two applications to communicate with each other.

==> REST API follows a stateless communication protocol (typically HTTP) where you can perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a server.

CRUD Operations Example in Your Product App:
1. Create: Add a product (name, price, unit price, quantity, image link).
2. Read: Fetch the list of all products (displayed on the product list screen).
3. Update: Modify product details (e.g., price or quantity).
4. Delete: Remove a product from the list.

Why Postman is Used?
Postman is a popular tool used for API testing and debugging. Here's why developers rely on it:

1. Testing Endpoints Independently: Before coding in Flutter, you can verify if the API works correctly.
2. Saves Time: Quickly test your API requests and ensure the backend logic is working without building the entire UI.
3. Easy Debugging: Postman provides detailed error responses (like status codes and headers) if the API call fails.
4. Generate Requests: You can test different HTTP methods—POST, GET, PUT, DELETE—before integrating them into your app.
5. Automate: Helps simulate scenarios like invalid data inputs or missing fields to ensure robustness.

Your Use Case:
1. Add Product Screen (POST request):
   In this screen, you'll send a POST request with product details like:

JSON
Copy code
{
  "name": "Product A",
  "price": 100,
  "unit_price": 10,
  "quantity": 10,
  "image_link": "http://example.com/image.jpg"
}

# Postman helps you test this request to ensure the product is added correctly on the server.

2. Product List Screen (GET request):
This screen will use a GET request to fetch and display all products from the server.

  #Using Postman, you can verify the response structure, check if the products are correctly retrieved, and ensure there are no issues with the endpoint.


==> Flutter Integration Flow:
  1. Use the http package in Flutter to make REST API calls.

  2. For the Add Product Screen:

Future<void> addProduct(Map<String, dynamic> productData) async {
  final url = 'https://your-api-endpoint.com/products';
  final response = await http.post(
    Uri.parse(url),
    body: jsonEncode(productData),
    headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
  );

  if (response.statusCode == 201) {
    print('Product added!');
  } else {
    print('Failed to add product: ${response.body}');
  }
}


  3. For the Product List Screen:

Future<List<dynamic>> fetchProducts() async {
  final url = 'https://your-api-endpoint.com/products';
  final response = await http.get(Uri.parse(url));

  if (response.statusCode == 200) {
    return jsonDecode(response.body);
  } else {
    throw Exception('Failed to load products');
  }
}



Using Postman before Flutter integration allows you to confirm that your API endpoints are functioning correctly, making it easier to spot issues if something goes wrong in your app.
